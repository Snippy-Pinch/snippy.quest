            <p>Then <span class="emphasis">Ruger joins in</span>. And that's different.</p>
            <p>Ruger is a seven-year-old Rottweiler who doesn't bark at anything. Ruger has seen coyotes trot through the yard and didn't bother getting up. Ruger once watched a rattlesnake cross the porch and just <em>looked at it</em>.</p>

            <p>Dale goes out again. Boots, Carhartt, the .30-06 because why not. The dogs <span class="emphasis">won't come with him</span>. He's never seen that before. Biscuit, who chases everything, <em>won't leave the porch</em>. Just stands there barking into the dark like he's trying to keep it from coming closer.</p>
            <p>Dale walks fifty yards toward the tree line. The snow crunches under his boots. He stops.</p>
            <p>There are <span class="emphasis">tracks</span>.</p>
            <p>They're wrong. They look like boot prints at first, but the stride is too long and they're <em>barefoot</em>. In February. In South Dakota. And halfway across the field they change — the toes spread wider, the heel narrows, like whatever was walking <span class="loud">forgot how feet work</span>.</p>
            <p>The tracks lead to within forty yards of the house. Then they stop. Then they go back toward the trees.</p>
            <p class="whisper">Then they stop being tracks at all.</p>

            <p>Dale is back inside. Doors locked. He hasn't locked the doors in thirty years of living here. There's nothing to lock them against. The nearest neighbor is <span class="emphasis">four miles east</span>.</p>
            <p>"What was out there?" Connie asks from the bedroom doorway.</p>
            <p>"I don't know."</p>
            <p>"The dogs—"</p>

            <p>Biscuit goes quiet first. Not gradually — <span class="loud">all at once</span>. Like a switch. Ruger keeps going for another ten minutes, then he stops too. The silence is worse than the barking.</p>
            <p>Dale looks out the window. Both dogs are on the porch, pressed against the front door, <span class="emphasis">whining</span>.</p>
            <p>They're not looking at the tree line anymore.</p>
            <p class="whisper">They're looking at the barn.</p>

            <div class="chapter-time">6:45 AM</div>
            <p>Morning. Gray light. Dale hasn't slept. He walks to the barn with the rifle because the horses need feeding and he's not the kind of man who doesn't feed his horses.</p>
            <p>The barn door is open. He closed it last night. He always closes it.</p>
            <p>Inside, the horses are in their stalls. They're calm. Too calm. They don't look at him when he comes in. They're looking at the far corner of the barn where the hay bales are stacked.</p>
            <p>There's <span class="emphasis">something behind the hay</span>.</p>
            <p>It's not moving. It might be a person. It has the <em>shape</em> of a person. But the proportions are slightly off — the arms are a little too long, the shoulders a little too narrow, and it's <span class="loud">perfectly still</span> in a way that living things aren't.</p>
            <p>Dale raises the rifle.</p>
            <p>"Hey."</p>
            <p>Nothing.</p>
            <p>"Hey, you need to come out of there."</p>
            <p class="whisper">It tilts its head. Not like a person turns to look at you. Like a dog hearing a new sound. Forty-five degrees. Too far.</p>

            <div class="reveal-text">It was The Thing.</div>
            <p>The dogs knew. They always know. They barked all night because something came out of the dark that <em>looked right</em> but <em>smelled wrong</em>, and every instinct in their hundred-thousand-year-old DNA screamed at them to sound the alarm.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;">They were right.</p>

            <p>When Connie calls the sheriff, she can't explain what Dale saw in the barn because Dale can't explain it either. By the time Deputy Reeves drives the fourteen miles from town, there's nothing in the barn but hay and horse shit and <span class="emphasis">a smell</span> Reeves can't identify but will think about for years.</p>
            <p>The tracks in the snow lead from the tree line to the barn. From the barn, they lead north across the pasture toward the creek.</p>
            <p>After the creek, there are no tracks.</p>
            <p>Biscuit and Ruger sleep inside now. Dale doesn't argue about it anymore.</p>
            <p class="whisper">Some nights, around 3 AM, Ruger lifts his head and stares at the north-facing window. He doesn't bark. He just watches.</p>
            <p class="whisper">That's worse.</p>
